Here's my pitch, 2-3 level based game, an archer and his trusty bow will have to face his foes to defeat the eternal dragon and save your beloved daughter.
On the first level, you make your way through a hidden forest as you face man-eating lizards. Second level, you stumble upon the volcano where the dragan nest's 
at the top of the volcano. As you make your up the volcano, you must dodge rolling bolders thrown by the dragon. Finally, you face the dragon. You must shoot
the dragon with your bow and dodge fireblasts being hurled at you. To win, you must defeat the dragon and bring home your daughter. Get devoured by your enemies
or get squashed by a boulder? You lose. I don't really see any specific skills im looking for, all i expect is that we all do our part of the job as a team, and
have a fun time doing it. :)
